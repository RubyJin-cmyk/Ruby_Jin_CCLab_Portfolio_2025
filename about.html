  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <main>

  <h2>Education</h2>

  <p>I’m currently a sophomore, exploring the space where art meets technology. My projects often blend illustration, interactive sketches, and creative coding, letting me experiment with new ways of making ideas tangible.</p>


  <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>

  <p>I love illustration and sketching, and after discovering creative technology, I’ve also gotten into making physical projects with Arduino, soldering, and hands-on tinkering. Combining digital and physical creation has become a big part of how I like to express myself.</p>


  <h2>Career Goals</h2>

  <p>I hope to work in creative coding, interactive media, or digital art, where I can combine artistic expression with technical skills to make experiences that are playful, thoughtful, and personal.</p>


  <h2>Reflections on Technology & Coding</h2>

  <p>

  Coding and technology feel like new brushes in my creative toolkit. They let me turn ideas—whether digital sketches or interactive installations—into experiences that can be touched, seen, or played with, giving life to concepts in ways traditional media can’t.
